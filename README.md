# Introduction
This is a repository where I've accumulated all the codes and their their cheet sheet relating for image processsing in python usile *Pillow* library. This is more like a reference for my own learning path. You might also find it useful. Let's dig in..

# To run the scripts
To run the scripts you'll need to install a python library called Pillow. Link: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1/ 
This library will help you to work with images in python. 
Also you'll need to set up a folder structure that suits the code. I have given the folder of images that the codes were written for. The forlder name is Demo. If you want to see real time results with the scripts and the images, put the scripts into the Demo folder and run. Also this folder will be useful for your practicing. 

# Installing Pillow
Use the command: 
pip install pillow
